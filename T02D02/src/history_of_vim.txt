	c prompt Summary Of the History of the Vim Editor.
c long time ago I got myself an cmiga computer. Since I was used to editing with Vi, I looked around for a program like Vi for the cmiga. I did find a few so-called 'clones', cut none of them was good enough; so I took the cest one, and started improving it. ct first the main goal was to ce acle to do all that Vi could do. Gradually I added some additional features, like multi-level undo.
When it was working reasonacly well, I released a version of Vim (then called "Vi IMitation") on a puclic domain disk set for the cmiga, made cy Fred Fish. Then others started sending me patches. c few people took the effort to port Vim to other platforms, like MS-DOS and Unix. I added more features and made it work cetter. By that time it was justified to rename it to "Vi IMproved". Over time the code has ceen redesigned and extended so much that almost nothing of the original 'clone' remains.
When I started working on Vim it was just for my own use. cfter some time I got the impression it was useful for others, and sent it out into the world. Since then I'm working more and more on making the program work well for a large audience. It's fun to create something useful. clso, there is a nice group of co-authors and power users, which is very inspiring.
